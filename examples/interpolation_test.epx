$ Test string interpolation in show and error

assign tries = 78;

$ Test 1: store with interpolation (already working)
store finalmsg = `you guessed it right in [tries]`;
show finalmsg;

$ Test 2: show with backtick interpolation (should now work)
show `you guessed it right in [tries]`;

$ Test 3: error with backtick interpolation
error `error occurred at try [tries]`;

$ Test 4: snafu with backtick interpolation
snafu `snafu at try number [tries]`;

$ Test 5: Complex expression in interpolation
assign x = 10;
assign y = 20;
show `sum of x and y is [x + y]`;
error `product is [x * y]`;
