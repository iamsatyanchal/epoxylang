## Introduction

Epoxy is a modern hybrid programming language designed to make programming more intuitive and expressive. It bridges the gap between human-readable, non-programmer-friendly syntax and the JavaScript ecosystem.

Epoxy is readable, concise, clean and powerful. Its human friendly syntax makes code read almost like natural language. While you may write slightly more verbose code compared to traditional languages, this verbosity dramatically improves code comprehension, making it ideal for beginners learning to program and for teams conducting code reviews.

The `@js` hybrid feature enables seamless JavaScript interoperability, allowing you to easily embed raw JavaScript code anywhere when needed. Codes writen in Epoxy compiles efficiently to JavaScript and runs on Node.js.

> **Philosophy**  
> Epoxy prioritizes clarity over brevity. Code is read far more often than it is written,  
> so Epoxy’s explicit syntax ensures that anyone, from beginners to experienced developers  
> can understand your code at a glance.

## Installation

Install Epoxy globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g epoxylang

This makes the `epoxy` CLI available system-wide.

## Getting Started

Create a file with the `.epx` extension:

```epoxy
assign name = :input;
show "Hello, " + name + "!";
```

Run it using:

```bash
epoxy hello.epx
```
